Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. There are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts. 
Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on  temperature and precipitationare important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day.
 Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.
